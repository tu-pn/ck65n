# Getting Started with Espressif ESP32-S2 boards on Amazon FreeRTOS

## Set up the Espressif hardware
See the [ESP32-S2-Saola-1 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.2/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-saola-1-v1.2.html) for more information about setting up the ESP32-S2-Saola-1 development board hardware.

## Set up your development environment
To communicate with your board, you need to download and install a toolchain.

### Setting up the toolchain
1. Navigate to esp-idf directory (`cd ./vendors/espressif/esp-idf`)
2. Run install.sh script which installs required tools (`./install.sh`)
3. Run export.sh to add required tools to environment PATH (`. ./export.sh`)

**Note:**
ESP32-S2 compiler is supported by ESP-IDF v4.2 only, you must use the supported compiler version to build FreeRTOS application. To check the version of your compiler, run the following command.
```
xtensa-esp32s2-elf-gcc --version
```

Above command should print following output:
```
xtensa-esp32s2-elf-gcc (crosstool-NG esp-2020r3) 8.4.0

## Build, flash, and run the FreeRTOS demo project
You can use CMake to generate the build files, build the application binary and Espressif's IDF utility to flash your board.
### To generate the demo application's build files with CMake
```
cmake -DVENDOR=espressif -DBOARD=esp32s2_saola_1 -DCOMPILER=xtensa-esp32s2 -S . -B build-directory -GNinja
```
**Note**: If you want to generate the test application build files, add the -DAFR_ENABLE_TESTS=1 flag

### To build the application
Use Espressif's IDF utility to build the application:
```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py -B build-directory build
```

Or use the generic CMake interface to build the application:
```
cmake --build build-directory
```

### Flash and run FreeRTOS
Use Espressif's IDF utility (freertos/vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py) to flash your board, run the application, and see logs.
To erase the board's flash, go to the freertos directory and use the following command:
```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py -B build-directory erase_flash
```

You can use the IDF script to flash your board:
```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py -B build-directory flash
```

To monitor:
```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py -B build-directory monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB1
```
